## Description

This repository contains Python notebooks which apply the backtracking algorithm to solve and generate several logic-based puzzles. With these notebooks it is possible to obtain all the solutions of a given puzzle (if more than one are present), and to generate from scratch new puzzles with a unique solution. More precisely:
* The notebook ```sudoku.ipynb``` implements a solver and a generator for Sudoku.
* The notebook ```skyscrapers.ipynb``` implements a solver and a generator for Skyscrapers puzzle.
* The notebook ```futoshiki.ipynb``` implements a solver and a generator for Futoshiki.

More puzzles will be considered in the future.
